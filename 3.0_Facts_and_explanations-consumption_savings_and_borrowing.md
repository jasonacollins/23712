# 3.0 Facts and explanations: consumption, savings and borrowing

In the first week of this module we will look at a series of facts about individual or household financial behaviour, examine where that behaviour is inconsistent with traditional economic explanations, and examine possible explanations that can account for the observed behaviour.

We will do this across two areas:
- consumption and savings
- borrowing

We will cover payments, investment and insurance in the second week of the module.
