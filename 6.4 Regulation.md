# Regulation

One direct means of improving financial decision making is through regulatory obligations placed upon financial service providers.

Many of the interventions that we identified in the first half of this module could be (or are) imposed by regulation. This includes the MySuper defaults, the forthcoming deferred sales requirement for add-on insurance, and the many forms of mandatory disclosure.

Other examples of regulatory interventions include:

- Cooling off periods: This prevents people making purchases made when they were in an emotional state (or enables them to unwind them), and provides an opportunity for reflection and price comparison.
- Restricting the use of certain defaults: As defaults are sticky, legislating the better default may improve outcomes. For example, financial advisers in Australia are now required to periodically renew the client agreement for ongoing fees, a change from the previous default arrangement of ongoing fees.
- Price caps: If competition in a market is for naive, price-insensitive customers, price caps can limit the damage. As noted earlier in this course, payday lending fees in Australia are capped. Price caps can, however, reduce supply if poorly targeted.
