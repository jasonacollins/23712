# 2.4 Mental accounting

>Imagine we just spent \$100 for a ticket to the hottest new Broadway show. It’s a musical combining potty-mouthed Muppets, sassy superheroes, Founding Fathers and high school hijinks. When we arrive at the theatre on opening day, we look in our wallet and discover to our horror that we’ve lost the ticket. Luckily, we have another \$100 note in our wallet. Would we buy another ticket? When people are asked this question, the vast majority say no. After all, they’ve spent the money on the ticket, the ticket is lost, and that’s just too bad. Now, if we ask people to imagine that they went ahead and bought a replacement ticket, how much would they say that night of theatre cost them? Most people say the experience cost them \$200 – the combined cost of the first and the second ticket.

>Now imagine things went differently on the day of the show. We didn’t buy a ticket in advance, but we’re still just as excited about the production. When we arrive at the theatre, we open our wallet and realize we lost one of the two crisp \$100 notes we had in there. Oh, no! We are now \$100 poorer. Luckily, we still have another \$100 note. Oh, yes! So, would we buy the ticket or just go home? In this case, the clear majority of people say they would buy the ticket. After all, what does losing a \$100 note have to do with not going to the theatre? And, if like most people, we were to go ahead and get the ticket, how much would we feel we’d paid for it? In this case, the most common answer we get is \$100.

Does this behaviour make economic sense?

The behaviour of those who will not buy a replacement ticket in the first instance, but will in the second, involves **mental accounting**. Mental accounting was named by Richard Thaler, who described several different ways that we form mental accounts. These include putting labels on different pots of money, and creating mental accounts that are linked to a topic or temporary occasion.

In the case of our potential Broadway Show attendees, \$100 has already been spent in the entertainment account. They are not willing to increase their expenditure to \$200. In the second, nothing has yet been spent on the entertainment account. The loss of the \$100 note does not change that, so they are willing to increase their expenditure in that account to \$100.

Mental accounting provides a hook for the application of prospect theory. Gains and losses are assessed within mental accounts. The reference point is shaped by the mental account, not their entire financial position.
