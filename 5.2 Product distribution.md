# 5.2 Product distribution

The process of product distribution often results in the wrong customers being in the wrong products.

The below provides two illustrations of how distribution design could affect consumer decision making.

## Add-on insurance

Customer outcomes can often be improved simply by ceasing poor distribution practices. Add-on insurance provides an illustration of this.

Add-on insurance is an insurance product sold to accompany another financial transaction, such as purchase of a motor vehicle or a credit product. The add-on insurance then covers events associated with that other transaction, such as a motor vehicle accident. Consumer credit insurance, which we covered on page 4.3 [ADD LINK], is typically sold as add-on insurance.

Add-on insurance is not usually offered up-front, but rather only at the completion of the purchase of the associated product. As a result, the customer has typically not prepared for the purchase of insurance, such as researching the market or shopping around. This means customers are often buying the first and only insurance product they see. They are more likely to accept very expensive offers and unlikely to choose the best deal available (as the add-on offer is rarely the best deal). The relativity of the add-on price to the primary product (e.g. a car) also reduces the attention given to the add-on price. Further, some consumers are confused about whether they are required to purchase the insurance as a condition of buying the product.

The Financial Services Royal Commission recommended that add-on insurance providers be required to change distribution practices by adopting a deferred sales model. Add-on insurance should not be offered until a set time after the sale of the product to which it relates. A deferred model will make the price of the add-on more salient, increase the likelihood of price comparison or shopping around, and enable decision making at a time where they may be experiencing decreased cognitive load. It also removes any confusion about the insurance being a condition of the purchase.

The Australian Government released exposure draft legislation for this model in early 2020, but it has not yet been implemented.

## Default retirement savings

Defaults are a powerful distribution feature.

Automatic enrolment of employees into retirement savings plans has been one of the most successful behavioural interventions to shift employee behaviour. Madrian and Shea examined automatic enrolment in 401(k) plans. They found that participation was materially increased. Among those with 3 to 15 months tenure, the increase due to default enrolment was an increase from around 37% to 86% participation.

In the case of retirement savings in Australia, we have a mandatory default requirement to contribute a portion of our salary. Obviously, it is successful in achieving higher participation in retirement savings.

The Australian superannuation system also has voluntary defaults in the form of the particular superannuation provider (an employer selected default) and the investment options within that provider. The stickiness of those defaults and the high fees (poor outcomes) led to the "MySuper" legislation with default low-fee low-frill accounts. Around two out of three members stick with their fund's default option, so defaulting into the best designed option could deliver substantial benefits.

Defaults are also set for death, total permanent disability and income insurance within superannuation. As for default funds, these are sticky. The question then becomes what default is better for customers. Recent government reforms mean that account holders are not defaulted into insurance if they are under 25 or have a balance of less than $6000.
