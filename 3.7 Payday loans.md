# 3.6 Payday loans

Relative to credit cards, payday loans charge a higher rate of interest, with short-term charges implying huge annual costs.

Payday lending has been subject to much regulatory and legislative action in Australia in recent years. Since 2012, payday loan interest and fees have been legislatively capped. The caps are:

- Establishment fee of 20% of the amount borrowed
- Maximum monthly fee of 4% of the amount borrowed
- Default fees up to a maximum of double the amount you borrowed
- Can also pass on government fees and charge missed payment fees and enforcement expenses

Even though capped, this structure can lead to very high interest rates, particularly when considered on an annual basis. Consider a one month loan with the establishment and monthly fee. That is effectively 24% interest for one month!

## Harm to consumers

There is an active academic debate on whether payday loans are helpful or harmful.

On the evidence of harm, people tend to use payday loans even though less expensive options are available. Bertrand and Morse (2011) showed that better disclosure marginally reduces take-up, suggesting payday loan use is at least partly due to misunderstanding the terms or consequences of the loan. (We will tackle disclosure in more detail in the third and final module for this unit.) Further, the debt burden created by payday loans can lead to a debt spiral that harms the ability to cover basic financial needs.

An important consideration, however, is the counterfactual of whether the harm would occur in the absence of the payday loans. Bhutta et al (2016) found evidence that, when payday lending is banned, people shift to other forms of high-interest credit rather than shifting back to traditional credit instruments. This may suggest that constraints to payday lending are addressing the symptom rather than the cause. 

## Who uses payday lenders?

Payday loan use is linked to low self control and low financial literacy.

Gathergood (2012) examined payday loan use in a survey sample where self control was measured by self-reported agreement with statements such as "I am impulsive and tend to buy things even when I can't really afford them." He found a that those with low self-control were more likely to use payday loans, although there were various mechanisms by which this occurred. Low self-control people had more income shocks. They were more likely to have other sources of credit withdrawn. They had more unforeseen durable expenses. All of these could trigger a need for high-cost short-term credit.

You can think about the low self-control in terms of present bias. Payday lending attractive is presence of high $\beta$; that is, a large discount for any delay. However, the variety of mechanisms by which payday loans are required suggests we require a richer story than high present bias.

As for credit cards, financial literacy may also play a role. Payday lender users score poorly on tests of financial literacy. Lusardi and Scheresberg (2013) found that those with high financial literacy (measured by answering each of the numeracy, inflation and diversification questions) were around 5 percentage points less likely to use a payday lender (20% compared to 25% across the full sample).
