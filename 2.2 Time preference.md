# 2.2. Time preference

Saving, borrowing, investment and insurance decisions all involve intertemporal choice. Decisions are made at one point in time, with effects at another. The timing of the costs and benefits do not align.

People discount future costs and benefits. They prefer to receive benefits earlier, rather than later, and prefer to incur costs later rather than earlier.

We have already encountered discounting in this unit (page 1.2), where Julia had the utility function:

$U=u(C_0)+\beta u(C_1)$

$0 \leq \beta \leq 0$

where $U$ is utility, and $C_0$ and $C_1$ are consumption in the first and second periods respectively. $\beta$ is a discount factor reflecting how much Julia weights consumption in the future relative to today.

You have also discussed time preference in detail in other units in this course. A recap of some core concepts is below.

## Exponential discounting

Exponential discounting occurs where future costs and benefits are discounted at a consistent rate through time. The following equation is an example of exponential discounting.

$U=\sum_{t=0}^{t=T}\delta^t u(C_t)$

$0 < \delta \leq 1$

The degree of discounting in this equation evolves over time as 1, $\delta$, $\delta^2$, $\delta^3$, $\delta^4$ and so on. This results in a smooth decline in present value over time. Decisions made with exponential discounting are consistent over time.

## Present bias

Present bias occurs when we place additional weight on costs and benefits at the present time. One simple model of present bias is the quasi-hyperbolic discounting model (it is a discrete time version of hyperbolic discounting).

$U=u(C_0)+\sum_{t=1}^{t=T}\beta\delta^t u(C_t)$

The degree of discounting in this equation evolves over time as 1, $\beta\delta$, $\beta\delta^2$, $\beta\delta^3$, $\beta\delta^4$ and so on. This progression results in a larger discount for the first period of delay ($\beta\delta$) than the degree of discount for each subsequent period of delay ($\delta$). There is a relative weighting toward the present.

Present bias of this nature can result in time inconsistency, with decisions at one point reversed at another if given the opportunity.
