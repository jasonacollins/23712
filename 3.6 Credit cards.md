# 3.6 Credit cards

Credit cards present three puzzles that a traditional economic framework has difficulty resolving.

- People borrow far more on credit cards that you would expect from exponentially discounters
- People fail to choose credit cards with the lowest borrowing costs
- People hold both high-cost credit card debt and liquid assets that earn low rates of return.

## Excessive borrowing

Although it is possible to justify borrowing at any interest rate if income is sufficiently lumpy, the levels of observed credit card debt are hard to justify. In particular, the impatience required to justify the high levels of credit card debt does not reconcile with the patience required to justify the savings in illiquid assets such as housing and retirement accounts.

Present bias provides one possible explanation. As noted in the discussion of savings, illiquid savings are hard to access immediately, and so their potential consumption is substantially discounted by someone with high present bias. This enables savings of illiquid assets. However, consumption using a credit card suffers no such discount. It can occur immediately. Meier and Sprenger (2010) found that more present biased individuals were more likely to have credit card debt and had higher levels of debt.

## Poor card choices

The explanation of present bias is, however, incomplete, as demonstrated by another puzzle. People don't choose the credit card with the lowest borrowing costs.

At least a part of this relates to customers being attracted by teaser rates, which they pay more attention to than the long-term rates they will end up paying.

Customers also exhibit poor understanding of exponential growth and how a credit card debt can compound over time. (Recall the compounding question that formed part of the financial literacy test.) Poor understanding of compounding can lead to an underestimation of the cost of high interest rates.

## Co-holding debt and savings

People often hold both high-cost credit card debt and *liquid* assets that provide low rates of return. In one UK survey, 12% of households in the sample held an average of $\pounds$3800 in revolving credit on which they incurred interest charges, while at the same time holding liquid assets that they could use to clear all of this debt.

One rational explanation for co-holding is that that some expenses must be paid by cash or direct debit, not credit card. This requirement means that funds must be available in these forms.

An alternative explanation is that co-holding is a self-control strategy. By reducing the amount of unused credit capacity, it may reduce future spending. (Note the use of mental accounts here.)

One shortfall with these explanations is that people who hold multiple cards do not minimise costs when using the cards they have. They pay little attention to relative interest rates when choosing which card to use. They don't repay the card with highest interest rate first.
