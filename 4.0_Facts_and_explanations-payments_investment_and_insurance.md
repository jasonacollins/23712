# Facts and explanations

In the second week of this module, we will continue our examination of facts about individual or household financial behaviour, examine where that behaviour is inconsistent with traditional economic explanations, and examine possible explanations that can account for the observed behaviour.

In the previous week, we examined consumption, savings and borrowing. This week we will examine:
- payments
- investment
- insurance.
