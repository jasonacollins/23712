# 2.1 Financial literacy

Many people have low financial literacy. 

In the 2018 HILDA survey, 42.5% of participants got all five of the financial literacy questions you answered in the first module correct. The proportion of correct responses for each question was:

- Numeracy: 85.5%
- Inflation: 69.8%
- Diversification: 74.9%
- Risk-return: 83.5%
- Money illusion: 77.0%

Remember that all except the numeracy question were multiple choice.

The *Australian Financial Attitudes and Behaviours Tracker*, a periodic survey run by ASIC, consistently finds that only one-third of respondents have heard of and understand the risk-return trade-off. Only 40% have heard of and understand the concept of diversification.

You can see how misunderstanding of these concepts could affect borrowing, savings, investment and insurance decisions. To determine the benefits of savings or costs of borrowing, you need base numeracy and need to understand inflation. Diversification is a core principle to achieving investment returns at lower risk. 

There is considerable research demonstrating a correlation between financial literacy and financial wellbeing, as well as other financial outcomes. Financial literacy is correlated with day-to-day financial management skills, financial market participation and investment, the holding of precautionary savings, planning for retirement, cheaper mortgages, more regular refinancing of debt, and lower transaction costs, among other things.

However, the evidence of a **causal** relationship between the financial literacy and financial outcomes is debated. We will discuss this debate later in the unit.
