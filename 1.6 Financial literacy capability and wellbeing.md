# Financial literacy, capability and wellbeing

In the first half of this module we examined the classical economic foundations to some financial activities. There the objective of the consumer is taken to be the maximisation of their expected utility.

Expected utility maximisation is typically not the most practicable framework for assessing whether someone is achieving their financial objectives. The dominant approach in assessing financial outcomes in applied settings is **financial wellbeing**. How can we improve our customers' or the population's financial wellbeing?

In attempting to improve financial wellbeing, a number of intermediate objectives are often targeted, such as financial literacy, financial capability, and financial resilience. I will define each of these below, together with financial wellbeing. These definitions are often debated - you don't need to get into the semantics - but you should be able to distinguish between them.

## Financial literacy

Financial literacy is the ability to make informed judgements and to take effective decisions regarding the use and management of money. It is concerned with people's skills and knowledge of financial information.

On the previous page you took a test of financial literacy. The first three questions are classic financial literacy questions that are used in many surveys globally. Those three questions plus the latter two are currently asked as part of the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey, a household-based panel study conducted annually in Australia. The questions cover:
- numeracy, via the ability to do simple calculation involving compounding of interest rates
- understanding of inflation
- knowledge of diversification
- understanding of the risk-return trade-off 
- the money illusion.

There is a high correlation between financial literacy and financial outcomes. But this does not mean that measures intended to target financial literacy are valuable. One study by Fernandes et al (2014) found that interventions to improve financial literacy explain 0.1% of the variance in behaviours studied, although some recent arguments are more positive (e.g. Kaiser et al (2020)). We will discuss this in further detail in Module 3 of this unit.

## Financial capability

Financial capability is the combination of knowledge, skills, attitudes and behaviours necessary to make sound financial decisions, based on personal circumstances, to improve financial wellbeing. 

Financial capability includes financial literacy, but extends to capture attitudes and behaviours.

Many organisations with a historic remit to improve financial literacy have broadened their scope to financial capability (including ASIC). This was in part a recognition that literacy was an overly narrow approach to improving financial wellbeing.

## Financial resilience

Financial resilience is the ability to access and draw on internal capabilities and appropriate, acceptable and accessible external resources and supports in times of financial adversity. In essence, financial resilience is how people are able to draw on resources when struggling. Financial resilience includes but is broader than literacy as it includes attitudes and external factors.

## Financial wellbeing

Financial wellbeing is when a person is able to meet expenses and has some money left over, is in control of their finances and feels financially secure, now and in the future. Financial wellbeing is an outcome metric. It is  what interventions relating to the other concepts are trying to achieve.

Financial wellbeing is also essentially a subjective measure (once basic needs are met), but objective outcomes are major determinants of subjective wellbeing. It is generally wise to consider both.

As an example of the types of questions in a financial wellbeing survey, the following are drawn from the CFPB Financial Wellbeing Scale:

>This statement describes me (completely, very well, somewhat, very little, not at all):
>1. I could handle a major unexpected expense
>2. I am securing my financial future
>3. Because of my money situation, I feel like I will never have the things I want in life
>4. I can enjoy life because of the way I’m managing my money
>5. I am just getting by financially
>6. I am concerned that the money I have or will save won’t last
