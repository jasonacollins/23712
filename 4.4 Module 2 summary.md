# 4.4 Module 2 summary

In this module, we have examined a series of facts about individual or household financial behaviour, asked where that behaviour is inconsistent with traditional economic explanations, and examined possible explanations that can account for the observed behaviour. We have done this across consumption and savings, borrowing, payments, investment and insurance.

Many of these behaviours led to sub-optimal outcomes for consumers. In the next module we examine how we can address many of these problems.

One company we are going to examine in the next module is Lemonade. In preparation for that module, look at their [website](https://www.lemonade.com/) and ponder what consumer problems they are attempting to solve.
