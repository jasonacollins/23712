# Module 1 overview

## Foundations

This module will span over approximately 2 weeks. During the first week, we will examine the types of financial decisions that we make and why they can be so hard. In the second week, we will examine what characteristics of human decision makers affect our financial decisions. 

By the end of this module,  you will be able to answer the following questions:

1. What is money?
2. Why do people save, borrow, invest and insure?
3. What is financial literacy, capability and wellbeing?
4. What preferences, heuristics and constraints shape our financial decisions?
