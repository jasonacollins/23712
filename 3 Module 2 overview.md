# Module 2 overview

## Financial behaviours

This module will span 2 weeks. Across these two weeks we will examine a series of facts about how people consume, save, borrow, pay, invest and insure. For each we will then examine what the potential explanations for the behaviours are. 

By the end of this module,  you will be able to answer the following questions:

1. How does people's behaviour vary from the traditional economic view that people smooth their consumption over the lifecycle?
2. What are some rational and psychological explanations for the pattern of consumption smoothing, saving, borrowing, payments, investment and insurance that we observe?
3. How do people use credit cards, mortgage and payday loans to borrow? What are possible explanations for the mix of these products that people use?
4. What are some puzzles in individual asset allocation and possible explanations for this behaviour?
5. Why do people often purchase too little insurance?

This module draws heavily on Beshears et al (2019).
