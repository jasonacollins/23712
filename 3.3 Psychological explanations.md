# 3.3 Psychological explanations

There are also many explanations for the lack of consumption smoothing based on consumer psychology. Below are three.

## Present bias

A prominent explanation of the lack of consumption smoothing is present bias.

Recall from page 2.2 that present bias (in a quasi-hyperbolic model) involves an immediate discount for any delay at all ($\beta$) on top of the regular exponential discount function.

The immediate discount of $\beta$ generates a distinction between the treatment of liquid and illiquid assets. An illiquid asset is impossible or costly to access for immediate consumption, so any consumption of the illiquid asset is always subject to a delay and a minimum discount of $\beta$, making is less attractive. Liquid assets such as cash are on hand for consumption now.

Someone with high present bias (i.e. $\beta$ substantially below one) will have trouble holding any liquid assets, but could accumulate substantial illiquid assets if they do not have a high rate of exponential discounting (i.e. $\delta$ is close to one). 

A related concept is myopia, whereby people consider their income over a limited horizon. This was a feature of Milton Friedman's (1957) original model of consumption smoothing. If people only think about their income for, say, the next three years, you will see some smoothing. But that smoothing will be limited compared to changes in income and consumption over the complete lifecycle.

## Mental accounting

Mental accounting provides a potential explanation for the differences in consumption based on where income came from and what bucket it is currently in. For instance, windfall gains may be in a different mental account to a pay rise, and consumed differently.

One mental account may be for wealth saved for retirement. US data suggests that the medium-term (6-month) marginal propensity to consume out of retirement accounts is effectively zero. The medium marginal propensity to consume out of a transaction account is close to one.

Mental accounts can also be defined around categories of expenditure. For example, money in form of shopping coupons increases shopping more than would be predicted by consumption smoothing. The value of the coupon is not spread over all  expenditures.

Mental accounting has some similarity to the liquidity explanation, but in the case of mental accounting it is a self-imposed category or rule. Liquidity constraints are external or natural features of the asset.

## Reference point models

Under prospect theory, utility is measured from a reference point. This reference point might be expectations for current consumption, which means that changes in consumption relative to expectations could generate (or cause the loss of) utility.

Suppose today I get to consume five pieces of chocolate. If I had previously expected to consume four pieces, this could generate extra utility. However, if I had previously expected to consume six, this would be painful. In fact, due to loss aversion, it would be more painful than the equivalent pleasant surprise.

This concept can lead to over-consumption, under-savings and high levels of co-movement between income and consumption (if you calibrate the model with certain parameters). For instance, a windfall in income today could be used to markedly increase consumption above expectations, giving a person utility both from the consumption itself and the pleasant surprise. Any consumption shifted into the future would not generate a pleasant surprise on the day of consumption, as by that time it would be expected.

A person's reference point may also be the consumption of others. Marianne Bertrand and Adair Morse (2016) argued that consumption among rich households had induced those at lower income to consume a larger share of their income.
