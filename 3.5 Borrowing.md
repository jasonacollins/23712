# 3.5 Borrowing

There is approximately \$3 trillion of debt held in Australia. Around \$2 trillion of that is held by households: \$1.2 trillion of owner-occupier housing credit, \$670 billion of investor housing credit, and \$150 billion of personal credit.

You can see that housing credit is the major form of credit in Australian households. Personal credit is much smaller, although this comes in varied forms: secured and unsecured personal loans, credit cards, payday loans, overdrafts, and so on.

Under the economic framework we examined earlier, people borrow to smooth consumption. If income is very lumpy and a person has no liquid savings, it is possible to rationalise borrowing at any interest rate, provided there is no alternative product available with a superior rate.

We have already seen that people do not smooth their consumption over their lifetime. So what role does borrowing play?

Over the next three pages we are going to examine three lending products (credit cards, payday loans and mortgages), the role that these might play in customers' lives, and some possible rationalisations for the pattern of use that we see.
