# 5.1 Product design

Product design is the first lever available to improve financial wellbeing. Good design can make distribution easier, and engagement after sale easier.

Similarly, behavioural interventions during distribution and after-sale engagement can be used to reduce the impact of poor design, but this often has lower efficacy than addressing the problem at source.

Many of the problems we have explored in this unit come through poor product design. The simple act of removing the problematic design features can solve the problem. The following are some examples:

1. The ability to give discretionary discounts to mortgagees reduces transparency and can lead to less-sophisticated customers paying higher interest. Common rates across customers advertised up-front would reduce that harm. 
2. Savers and borrowers are more attentive to initial rates (e.g. homeymoon rates) than to rates they will ultimately pay. A design with a lower initial rate will tend to lead consumers to underestimate the future costs of borrowing and to overborrow. Fixed flat interest rates can reduce that problem.
3. Balance transfer discounts on credit cards can lead to some customers paying substantial interest when their discount period ends, having either miscalculated the likelihood of clearing their debt in advance, or through simple lapse and failing to take an action such as moving to another card. Replacing balance transfer discounts with a lower flat interest rate through time can reduce that problem.

These remedies are not, however, without cost. There are typically trade-offs between customers (and obviously for  the firm itself). For instance, the removal of discretionary mortgage discounts may result in some borrowers paying more, and may even result in less credit availability for high-risk borrowers.

Similarly, balance transfer policies help credit card holders on net. The amount of credit card debt in Australia accruing interest has not increased in the last 15 years despite a more than 50% increase in credit card debt. The distribution of those payments, however, has changed markedly.

## Save More Tomorrow

The classic example of successful design of a financial product is the Save More Tomorrow Program. Under Save More Tomorrow, customers are asked to commit in advance to allocating a fraction of their future salary increases toward their retirement savings accounts.

Save More Tomorrow is designed to reduce loss aversion as a factor in deciding contribution amounts. A commitment of a proportion of pay rises means that the contribution can increase over time, but pay never decreases. The program capitalises on their propensity to stick with the status quo, as people are unlikely to unwind their future commitments despite being able to opt out at any time. That ability opt out also reduces regret/disappointment aversion.

The first tests of the Save More Tomorrow program resulted in 78 per cent of those offered the plan joining, 80% of those remaining in the plan through the fourth pay rise, and average savings rates increasing from 3.5% to 13.6% over 40 months. (Note the savings rate is higher than the default rate in Australia. Could the default in Australia create a low anchor for some people?)

## Example: Designing the bonus saver account

In the mid-term assignment (some of) you examined the 'bonus saver' account, whereby customers were required to deposit money and make no withdrawals to receive bonus interest. We noted that many customers fail to meet the criteria and as a result do not receive their bonus interest.

You noted that a range of customer characteristics could be causing those failures, including:
- Lack of attention or mental lapses, leading them to forget to deposit or to make a withdrawal without considering the consequences
- Present bias, whereby withdrawn money has far higher value today that the savings or potential interest
- Regret/disappointment aversion, whereby customers do not deposit (or constrain deposits) as they fear they may regret that later if they have to withdraw

One simple intervention to improve the customer decision would be to remove the requirement for deposit and/or withdrawal. The customer would no longer have an opportunity for failure, and the 'bonus' interest would be paid by default.

There are some questions we might wish to ask before taking this step:
1. Do the criteria to receive the bonus interest incentivise the accumulation of savings? Would removal of the criteria have unintended consequences for some customers?
2. Does this feature enable better pricing? What would be the negative effect on the interest received for those who normally met the criteria?
3. What are the distributional consequences of the pricing arrangement? What are the characteristics of those who fail to receive bonus interest and those who might receive lower interest if pricing was changed?

Obviously, the bank would likely have other questions. Does the ability to advertise a higher interest rate assist marketing? Is the product viable without the attraction of the bonus rate?
