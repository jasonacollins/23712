# 1. Household and individual finance foundations

Money touches our lives in many ways. We exchange it for goods and services to help us survive. We use it to buy things we need (and some things we don't). Money can pay for things or experiences that bring us joy, yet it can be a source of tension, stress and worry. We use money as a measure of status and self worth. 

Because of these many uses, most us think about money a lot: how much we have, how much we need, how to get more, what items cost, how much we will need in the future, how much our friends and family have. And as we grow older and the financial world becomes more advanced, our financial decisions become greater and more complex. Think about mortgages, investments, insurance, retirement plans. 

Many people struggle when it comes to money. 

- 40% of Australians are not confident in managing their money
- Over one third of Australians report that dealing with money is stressful and overwhelming
- At the time they were asked, one in five Australians did not save any money over the last six months
- Less than one in three Australians report having heard of and understood the concept of the risk-return trade-off

And these statistics are from before the pandemic.

Major drivers of our financial outcomes is our decisions and behaviour. Yet making poor money decisions is common. Our poor financial decisions leave us vulnerable to when "life happens".

In the first half of this *Foundations* module, we will examine what money actually is, some of the major economic functions of money, and why our behaviour with money isn't always straightforward.
