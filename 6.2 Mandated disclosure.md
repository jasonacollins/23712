# 6.2 Mandated disclosure

We have seen in this unit that the information provided to customers, whether in the form of marketing, more formal information provision, or advice, can affect customer decision making and financial wellbeing. This opens the door, at least theoretically, for mandated disclosure to improve outcomes.

However, the evidence for the positive effect of mandated disclosure is limited. Disclosure is often found to be inadequate to overcome fundamental problems with products, and can sometimes backfire.

One of the main barriers to disclosure is that complexity is hard to explain simply. If a product is complex, no amount of disclosure can change that. People can hold only a small number of chunks in their mind, and even if the language is plain, they will have that fundamental constraint.

The other barrier is that disclosure is typically implemented by self-interested firms. The idealised implementation wanted by a regulator and actual implementation are often markedly different. For example, find the required warning label on the homepage for [Nimble](https://nimble.com.au/).

Achieving the desired effect with disclosure is also difficult. Below is one example. 

## Superannuation disclosure

Australian superannuation funds are required to provide short product disclosure statements to customers. They are designed to be shorter than historic product disclosure statements and enable people to compare superannuation products across areas such as risk, returns and asset allocation.

Hazel Bateman and colleagues (2015) examined the effect of the standard information in these documents on consumer choice (using Unisuper templates as a foundation). They found that one third of consumers were not affected by the information provided and the risk information was irrelevant to three quarters.

The most influential element of the dashboard was the asset allocation pie chart. Customers preferred options where the assets were allocated evenly across the categories. This finding opens the potential for manipulation of choice by changing the asset categories such that allocations appear more even.
