# Subject overview

In this unit, we examine the drivers of financial decisions made by individuals and households. The subject will look at the many challenges individuals face to make good decisions: uncertainty, difficulty to stick to long-term plans, inaccurate beliefs about future risks and opportunities. This knowledge is useful in a wide range of industry applications from product design to marketing.

The unit is organised into three main modules:

- **Module 1 - Foundations**: What financial decisions do we need to make? Why do we obtain banking, insurance and investment products? What are some our characteristics that affect our financial decisions?
- **Module 2 - Financial behaviours - facts and explanations**: How do we actually make financial decisions? What are the explanations behind our patterns of behaviour?
- **Module 3 - Improving financial wellbeing**: How can financial products be designed and distributed to improve customer decision making? What other external tools can improve financial decisions?
