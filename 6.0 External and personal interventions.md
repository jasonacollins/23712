# 6 External and personal interventions

The first half of this module covered interventions that could be made by the financial services provider to improve customer outcomes.

In this second half we examine those interventions that can be made externally, either by the customer themselves, or by outsiders such as regulators or NGOs.

The interventions we will cover include:
- education and financial advice
- mandated disclosure
- product regulation
- personal measures to increase commitment and self-control
