# 6.3 Disclosure of conflicts of interest

Earlier in this unit we saw evidence that financial advisers often act in their own interest when giving advice to customers. Customers also appear to be naive as to these effects.

One possible intervention to overcome this conflict is to require disclosure of conflicts. However, there is experimental evidence that this could backfire.

Cain and colleagues (2005) found in a lab experiment that when conflicts of interest are disclosed, advisers give even more biased advice. This may be due to moral licensing, or a strategic response as the adviser believes they need to be more extreme in their recommendation in anticipation that their advice will be discounted. Consumers also fail to discount the advice due to the conflict as much as they should, even though disclosed. The net result is that disclosure could worsen outcomes.

Sah and colleagues (2012) show in another lab experiment that although disclosure can decrease trust in advice, it can create a perverse incentive for the customer to follow the advice. Failure to follow the advice would signal that they don't trust the adviser, creating social pressure to give in to the adviser's interest. Given the nature of this particular effect, disclosure of the conflict by an external party or an opportunity to make the decision to follow advice in private reduced the extent of this unintended consequence.
