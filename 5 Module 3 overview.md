# Module 3 overview

## Improving financial wellbeing

This module will span 2 weeks. Across these two weeks we will consider how to improve financial wellbeing using two lenses. In the first week we will examine how firms can improve financial wellbeing through the way they design and distribute their products, and interact with customers post sale. In the second week, we will examine financial wellbeing interventions that could be generated by regulators, NGOs and the decision-makers themselves. 

By the end of this module, you will be able to answer the following questions:

1. Why is product design critical in achieving better outcomes for customers?
2. How can product distribution and sale processes lead to the right products landing in the hands of the right customers?
3. How can financial services firms interact with customers post-sale to improve the way that they use financial products?
4. Can interventions to improve financial literacy improve customer financial wellbeing?
5. What role can regulation and disclosure requirements play in improving financial wellbeing?
6. What tools can consumers use to improve their own outcomes?
